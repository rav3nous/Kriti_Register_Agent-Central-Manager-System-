You: register
Agent:Hello! I am here to help you with the registration process. To get started, I need the following details from you:
1. Full Name
2. Email
3. Mobile Number (including country code)
4. Password

Kindly provide your full name to begin.
You: Pranav
Agent:Great, Pranav! Now please provide your email address.
You: 9877895643
Agent:The number you provided seems to be a mobile number. Please provide your email address for the registration process. Also, make sure to include the country code with your mobile number later for accuracy.
You: xyz@gmail.com
Agent:Thank you for providing your email address. Now, please provide your mobile number including the country code.
You: idk country code
Agent:No worries! Please tell me your country, and I will help you find the correct country code for your mobile number.
You: china
Agent:Once you provide your mobile number with the country code +86, we can proceed with the registration.
You: 9988767
Agent:Great! You provided the mobile number as +86 9988767.

Lastly, please set a password for your account. The password should be strong, ideally including letters, numbers, and special characters.
You: is my phine valid, do you provide sefvice in china
Agent:You asked if your phone number is valid and if the service is available in China.

Regarding phone number validity, the number you provided (9988767) seems quite short and may not be a complete mobile number for standard use in China. Typically, Chinese mobile numbers are 11 digits long following the country code (+86).

Regarding service availability, as an assistant, I need to check if the service is provided in China. Since this requires specific information about the service region, I suggest verifying from the official website or customer support for China region availability.

Would you like me to assist you further with phone number validation or any other part of the registration?
