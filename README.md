# Kriti_Register_Agent-Central-Manager-System-
This repository implements a Central Agent System for the Kriti app, featuring a dedicated register agent that manages user and app registration workflows. It enables modular, event-driven handling of registration processes for efficient onboarding and validation.

# This repository contains the implementation of a Central Agent System designed to orchestrate and manage registration workflows for the Kriti app. The core functionality revolves around the initialization of a specialized register agent, responsible for handling user and application registration processes in a robust, scalable manner.

Key Features:
Centralized Agent Architecture: Utilizes a central agent framework, ensuring modular and extensible handling of various app modules.

Register Agent Initialization: The register agent is dedicated to managing all aspects of registration within the Kriti app, including validating user input, tracking status, and integrating with backend services.

Event-Driven Communication: Agents interact through a well-defined, event-based protocol, making it easier to add, remove, or update features as requirements evolve.


Use Case
This setup is ideal for teams looking to implement a microservices-inspired approach to app feature management, particularly where robust registration handling are critical.

Example Usage:

Central agent invokes the register agent whenever a new registration event is detected in the Kriti app.

Register agent processes, validates, and confirms the registration, updating app status and notifying relevant services as needed.
